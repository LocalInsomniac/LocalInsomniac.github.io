					<h2>DOOM FROM AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE</h2>

					<b>Nobody Told Me About id</b> is a love letter from DOOM
					fans to the iconic trinity of Build Engine games; Duke
					Nukem 3D, Blood and Shadow Warrior. Whether it be ludicrous
					gibs or explosions, NTMAi tries its best to faithfully
					replicate all things Build on DOOM while also enhancing
					vanilla gameplay. Your arsenal may be tough, but some
					enemies will have a trick or two up their sleeves...
					<br><br>
					NTMAi originally started off as a small project during
					summer 2019. It went on to
					<a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/2020/gameplay/">win a Cacoward in 2020</a>
					and eventually got rebooted to a much better state in early
					2023.

					<h2>HURT ME PLENTY MORE</h2>

					Want some extra challenge? NTMAi also comes with built-in
					special support for the following WADs:

					<ul>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/125461">AD MORTEM</a></li>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/dbp37_augzen">AUGER;ZENITH</a></li>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/d64d2">DOOM 64 for DOOM II</a></li>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/eviternity">Eviternity</a></li>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/mayhem19">MAYhem 2019</a></li>
						<li><a href = "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=13600">Scythe 2</a></li>
					</ul>

					Playing these will automatically enable unique content;
					maybe even some new weapons and monsters to play with!
					<br><br>
					For maximum compatibility, make sure to load NTMAi
					<b>after</b> any of these WADs, otherwise you might get
					weird results.
