					<h3>BIO</h3>
					Nobody really knows where <b>Hunk</b> came from. All that's
					known is that ever since he appeared, his taller, lankier
					counterpart always comes around causing trouble across
					Dollop. Being the perfect candidate in liftocracy,
					Hunk is the only guy who has more than enough muscle to
					stop <b>Lank</b>, and you'd best hope you're not
					standing in his way.<br><br>
					
					<h3>TRIVIA</h3>
					Hunk literally started off as a random blob on a testing
					canvas. One of my friends saw the drawing and called him a
					"hunky boy", and that's where he got his name from. Hunk
					and his environment are basically a mishmash of
					out-of-left-field improvisation and an evergrowing love
					towards Drum and Bass.

					<h3>BIO</h3>
					<b>Gil “Gilbert” Senden</b> is a cosmic stuntman who's
					always dodging spikes and sawblades. Whether it's by using
					pogo sticks, jetpacks or even his sweet kicks,
					<b>Gilbert</b> is always knowledgeable on how to move
					around any obstacle course. He's just the coolest guy to be
					around, overall.<br><br>
					
					<h3>TRIVIA</h3>
					Back when dnb was in a very early phase, the player
					was originally a humanoid silhouette moving through
					outlined levels with a basic outer space background. In
					<a href = "assets/characters/dnb_test.mp4">this clip</a>,
					south.vibe's "<a href = "https://soundcloud.com/southvb/vague">vague [24.12]</a>"
					was playing in the background. Alongside the test
					footage's atmosphere, this greatly influenced Gilbert's
					final, laid-back stickman design:

						<sub>Concept art of Gilbert in dynamic poses</sub>
					</center></p>
					
					<br>
					dnb is on an indefinite hiatus at the time of writing this,
					but regardless of that I still had a fun time helping out
					on its development.

					<h3>BIO</h3>
					Large bolts gone loose in an excessively hazardous working
					environment? Not to worry - you can rely on <b>Video</b> to
					go and tighten them back into place. With her specialized
					exosuit, this cyborg is able to navigate around sites
					quickly and efficiently.
