        				Thanks for stopping by.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				This website works as a sort of portal to all of my social
        				media profiles and projects.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				My main interest is programming and game development; most of
        				my works are made in GameMaker, C++ or C#.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				I'm also quite avid when it comes to art and 3D modelling on
        				Blender.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Music making may not be my strongest suit, but I still do it
        				from time to time.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				I may also be known as "LocalInsomniac".
        			</p>
